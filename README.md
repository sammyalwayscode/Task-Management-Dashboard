## Design Choices

The design of the Task Management Dashboard was inspired by the color choices and aesthetics of [Teachmate AI](https://teachmateai.com). The aim was to create a visually appealing and cohesive experience for users familiar with the Teachmate brand.

### Navigation

To enhance user experience, two separate navigation sections were implemented in the sidebarâ€”one for viewing all tasks and another for filtering tasks based on their status. This design choice provides quick access to different views and improves overall navigation efficiency.

### Detail Page

A dedicated detail page for each task was created to allow users to access additional information and perform actions such as editing the task details, updating the task status, and deleting the task.

These design decisions aim to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making task management an efficient and enjoyable experience.
